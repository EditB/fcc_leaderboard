Free Code Camp Leaderboard project (with React)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It also has a CodePen version.

User Story: I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

User Story: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

User Story: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
